## Development

This project now includes a small Node/Express server to handle Google OAuth and Calendar API calls. To run locally:

1. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and provide your Google OAuth credentials.
2. Install dependencies and start the server:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.
